# OSM-iD-Browser-Tools

This is in progress. The extension is fully functional but missing a few features. These include: profiles for hotkeys (which tags to add to an item); integration with iD (most of the program runs by emulating user actions); add additional CSS image filters; choice of character to use for hotkeys.

For the iD editor on openstreetmap.org. Adds hotkeys for types: Building, severely damaged housing areas, and IDP informal camps. Adds brightness & contrast tool for satellite imagery. Adds a few other productivity tools.
