# OSM-iD-Browser-Tools
For the iD editor on openstreetmap.org. Adds hotkeys for types: Building, severely damaged housing areas, and IDP informal camps. Adds brightness & contrast tool for satellite imagery. Adds a few other productivity tools.

TODO: Add choice of SHIFT key.
TODO: Additional image filters.

UPDATE: v 1.20: May 16, 2015: Avoid emulating user actions for the most part. Apply tags with e.g. https://gist.github.com/bhousel/0af881a621a2efb83719. Update layout. Allow hotkey modification. Switch from SHIFT to CTRL/META. Override input.preset-search-input event.keypress when necessary.

UPDATE: v 1.11: May 12, 2015: Fixed where hotkey was not working because `A` element was toggled hidden. Fixed .replace of an integer.
