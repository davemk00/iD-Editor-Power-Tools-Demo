# OSM-iD-Browser-Tools
UPDATE: May 12, 2015: Fixed where hotkey was not working because `A` element was toggled hidden. Fixed .replace of an integer.

For the iD editor on openstreetmap.org. Adds hotkeys for types: Building, severely damaged housing areas, and IDP informal camps. Adds brightness & contrast tool for satellite imagery. Adds a few other productivity tools.

This is in progress but functional. The extension is missing a few features, which include: profiles for hotkeys (which tags to add to an item); integration with iD (most of the program runs by emulating user actions); add additional CSS image filters; choice of character to use for hotkeys.
